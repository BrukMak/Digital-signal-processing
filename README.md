## Introduction

Audio recordings often suffer from unwanted background noise that can degrade the quality and intelligibility of the content. This project addresses this issue by presenting a MATLAB-based audio processing solution that utilizes advanced filtering techniques to effectively reduce noise while preserving the integrity of the original audio signal. By leveraging this project, you can enhance the listening experience of your audio recordings.

## Features

- Noise reduction algorithms implementation in MATLAB.
- Support for various types of noise (e.g., white noise, ambient noise, impulse noise).
- Adjustable parameters to fine-tune noise reduction for different scenarios.
- Demonstrative examples showcasing noise reduction effectiveness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- MATLAB (version 9.1 or higher)
- [Optional] Sample audio recordings affected by noise for testing.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/BrukMak/Noise-detection-and-removal-from-corrupted-audio-file
```

2. Launch MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd /Noise-detection-and-removal-from-corrupted-audio-file
```

3. Open the main MATLAB script `main.m` to start using the audio noise reduction tool.

## Usage

1. Load your noisy audio recording by modifying the file path in the `main.m` script.
2. Adjust the noise reduction parameters to optimize the filtering process.
3. Run the script and listen to the output audio with reduced noise.
4. Experiment with different parameters to achieve the best noise reduction results.

## Algorithm

The core of this project's noise reduction lies in the implementation of advanced filtering techniques, including the median filter which is a non-linear digital filtering technique, often used to remove noise from an image or signal.
. These techniques have been selected for their effectiveness in preserving the audio's original quality while efficiently eliminating unwanted noise.

## Examples

To see the noise reduction in action, take a look at the `examples` directory in this repository. It contains audio recordings before and after applying the noise reduction algorithm. You can use these examples as a reference for understanding the potential impact of the algorithm on various types of noisy audio.
